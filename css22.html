        Wikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia, Slashdot postings, 
        and web search engine indexing. Language editions were created beginning 
        in March 2003, with a total of 161 in use by the end of 2004.[34][35] Nupedia and Wikipedia coexisted 
        until the former's servers were taken down permanently in 2003, and its text was incorporated into Wikipedia. 
        The English Wikipedia passed the mark of two million articles on September 9, 2007, making it the largest encyclopedia 
        ever assembled, surpassing the Yongle Encyclopedia made during the Ming Dynasty in 1408, which had held the record for
        almost 600 years. 

        Citing fears of commercial advertising and lack of control, users of the Spanish Wikipedia 
        forked from Wikipedia to create Enciclopedia Libre in February 2002.[37] Wales then announced 
        that Wikipedia would not display advertisements, and changed Wikipedia's domain from wikipedia.com
         to wikipedia.org.
        Though the English Wikipedia reached three million articles in August 2009, the growth of the edition, 
        in terms of the numbers of new articles and of editors, appears to have peaked around early 2007.[40] 
        Around 1,800 articles were added daily to the encyclopedia in 2006; by 2013 that average was roughly 800.[41] 
        A team at the Palo Alto Research Center attributed this slowing of growth to the project's increasing exclusivity
         and resistance to change.[42] Others suggest that the growth is flattening naturally because articles that could be 
         called "low-hanging fruit"—topics that clearly merit an article—have already been created and built up extensively.
